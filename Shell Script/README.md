# Assignment 1: Getting Acquainted with UNIX and C

This program creates 4 graphs in a file named collatz.pdf. The first graph plots the collatz sequence length of each collatz sequence from $n ∈ {2,...,10000} where n is the starting point of the collatz sequence. The second graph plots the maximum value from each collatz sequence  from $n ∈ {2,...,10000} where $n is the starting point of the collatz sequence. The third graph plots the frequency of each collatz sequence length for $n ∈ {2,...,10000} where n is the starting point of the collatz sequence. The fourth graph plots the frequency of each collatz sequence value for the values 0-100000 for $n ∈ {2,...,10000} where n is the starting point of the collatz sequence.

## Files to have in directory when running 'plot' program:

Ensure that the files Makefile, collatz.c, and plot.sh are in your current directory
before running plot.sh. 

## How to build plot.sh:

Run the following to build the 'plot' program:

$ chmod +x plot.sh

## How to run plot.sh:

$ ./plot.sh
